                <i>In this passage, an amateur theater group called the 
                    Laurel Players is putting on its frst production.</i>
                <br>
                (1) The Players, coming out of their various kitchen
                        doors and hesitating for a minute to button their
                        coats or pull on their gloves, would see a landscape
                        in which only a few very old, weathered houses
                        seemed to belong; it made their own homes look as
                        weightless and impermanent, as foolishly misplaced
                        as a great many bright new toys that had been
                        lef outdoors overnight and rained on. (2) Teir 
                        automobiles didn’t look right either—unnecessarily
                        wide and gleaming in the colors of candy and ice
                        cream, seeming to wince at each splatter of mud,
                        they crawled apologetically down the broken roads
                        that led from all directions to the deep, level slab
                        of Route Twelve. (3) Once there the cars seemed
                        able to relax in an environment all their own, a
                        long bright valley of colored plastic and plate glass
                        and stainless steel—KING KONE, MOBILGAS,
                        SHOPORAMA, EAT—but eventually they had to
                        turn of, one by one, and make their way up the
                        winding country road that led to the central high
                        school; they had to pull up and stop in the quiet
                        parking lot outside the high-school auditorium.
                    <br>
                        (4) “Hi!” the Players would shyly call to one
                        another.
                    <br>
                        (5) “Hi! . . .” (6) “Hi! . . .” (7) And they’d go
                        reluctantly inside.
                    <br>
                        (8) Clumping their heavy galoshes around the
                        stage, blotting at their noses with Kleenex and
                        frowning at the unsteady print of their scripts,
                        they would disarm each other at last with peals of
                        forgiving laughter, and they would agree, over and
                        over, that there was plenty of time to smooth the
                        thing out. (9) But there wasn’t plenty of time, and
                        they all knew it, and a doubling and redoubling
                        of their rehearsal schedule seemed only to make
                        matters worse. (10) Long afer the time had come
                        for what the director called “really getting this
                        thing of the ground; really making it happen,”
                        it remained a static, shapeless, inhumanly heavy
                        weight; time and time again they read the promise
                        of failure in each other’s eyes, in the apologetic
                        nods and smiles of their parting and the spastic
                        haste with which they broke for their cars and
                        drove home to whatever older, less explicit
                        promises of failure might lie in wait for them there.
                        11) And now tonight, with twenty-four hours to 
                        go, they had somehow managed to bring it of. 
                        (12) Giddy in the unfamiliar feel of make-up and 
                        costumes on this frst warm evening of the year, they 
                        had forgotten to be afraid:

                they had let the movement 
                of the play come and carry them and break like a 
                wave; and maybe it sounded corny (and what if it 
                did?) but they had all put their hearts into their work.          
                (13) Could anyone ever ask for more than that?
