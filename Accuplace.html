                    In this passage, an amateur theater group called the Laurel Players is putting on its first production.

                    (1) Te Players, coming out of their various kitchen
                    doors and hesitating for a minute to button their
                    coats or pull on their gloves, would see a landscape
                    in which only a few very old, weathered houses
                    seemed to belong; it made their own homes look as
                    weightless and impermanent, as foolishly misplaced
                    as a great many bright new toys that had been
                    lef outdoors overnight and rained on. (2) Teir 
                    automobiles didn’t look right either—unnecessarily
                    wide and gleaming in the colors of candy and ice
                    cream, seeming to wince at each splatter of mud,
                    they crawled apologetically down the broken roads
                    that led from all directions to the deep, level slab
                    of Route Twelve. (3) Once there the cars seemed
                    able to relax in an environment all their own, a
                    long bright valley of colored plastic and plate glass
                    and stainless steel—KING KONE, MOBILGAS,
                    SHOPORAMA, EAT—but eventually they had to
                    turn of, one by one, and make their way up the
                    winding country road that led to the central high
                    school; they had to pull up and stop in the quiet
                    parking lot outside the high-school auditorium.

                    stage, blotting at their noses with Kleenex and
                    frowning at the unsteady print of their scripts,
                    they would disarm each other at last with peals of
                    forgiving laughter, and they would agree, over and
                    over, that there was plenty of time to smooth the
                    thing out. (9) But there wasn’t plenty of time, and
                    they all knew it, and a doubling and redoubling
                    of their rehearsal schedule seemed only to make
                    matters worse. (10) Long afer the time had come
                    for what the director called “really getting this
                    thing of the ground; really making it happen,”
                    it remained a static, shapeless, inhumanly heavy
                    weight; time and time again they read the promise
                    of failure in each other’s eyes, in the apologetic
                    nods and smiles of their parting and the spastic
                    haste with which they broke for their cars and
                    drove home to whatever older, less explicit
                    promises of failure might lie in wait for them there.

                    The contrasts the narrator draws in sentences 1 and 2
                between the Players’ homes and the houses in the
                “landscape” and between the Players’ automobiles and
                the “roads” are most likely meant to suggest that the

                    accurately characterizes the claim that “there was plenty
